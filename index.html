										<h2>Food security</h2>
										<p>The availability of food irrespective of class, gender or region is another one.</p>
									</header>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>There is evidence of food security being a concern many thousands 
of years ago, with central authorities in ancient China and 
ancient Egypt being known to release food from storage in times of famine.
 At the 1974 World Food Conference, the term “food security” was defined with an emphasis on supply;
 food security is defined as the “availability at all times of adequate, nourishing, diverse, balanced 
and moderate world food supplies of basic foodstuffs to sustain a steady
 expansion of food consumption and to offset fluctuations in production and prices”</p>
								</div>
								<div class="col-4 col-12-medium">
									<p>Similarly, household food security is considered to exist when all members, at all times,
 have access to enough food for an active, healthy life. Individuals who are food secure do not live in hunger or fear of starvation. Food insecurity, on the other hand,
 is defined by the South Africa Department of Agriculture (SADA) as a situation of "limited or uncertain availability of nutritionally adequate and safe foods or limited 
or uncertain ability to acquire acceptable foods in socially acceptable ways"..</p>

							<h1>Agriculture is our wisest pursuit, because it will in the end contribute most to real wealth, good morals, and happiness

When tillage begins, other arts follow.</h1>
							<p> The farmers, therefore, are the founders of human civilization.
No race can prosper until it learns there is as much dignity in tilling a field as in writing a poem.

						<p>Do what you love to do, and be around things that make you smile. The cows make me smile every day.
The farmer has to be an optimist or he wouldn’t still be a farmer.
Farming is a profession of hope.
It is only the farmer who faithfully plants seeds in the Spring, who reaps a harvest in the Autumn
